the <head> tag is for the meta data - such as scripts 
the <header> tag is the most important part of the page

use only one <h1> per page

<nav> primarily used for screen readers, this is a navigation element. 

<main> designates the content of the website

<section> sectioning off content as a seperation for screen readers

<p> content or block of text

<ul> w/ each <li>   unordered list with each list element

list item can include other tags such as an <a href> anchor tag

<footer> similar to a <header> section but at the end (footer!)

<div> is more of a place holder - and a <section> is a repeated section

<aside> would be like a sidebar 

div === 'division' of the page; a very generic, non-semantic element.


in css

p {

}

p is known as the selector
 	{ 
	
 	--declaration block----\/
	attribute: values;
	
	}
	


element > classes > id

classes is if applying to more than one element

id is supposed to be specific to one
id's are the most specific.

polluting the global name space by using to many id's
can target multiple selectors

p, h1, h3 {
- declaration block would affect all selectors -- 
}

if you have 

div.my-class {

}

because there is no space - it will apply only to div with the class "my-class"

div, .my-class {

}
would apply to all divs, and to class "my-class"
